1 . A blockchain is an electronic public database that is shared accross a network. It is a decentralized setup since there is no direct control of the the database.  Unlike a regular database, a blockchain is an interconnected set of blocks instead of tables.  Each block contains data that is part of a transaction. The data is immutable; once the transaction occurs it can not be reversed.  
However similar to a database, there is a "primary key" that organizes the each piece of data.  It's called a hash.  Every block has a hash key and a hash key of the previous block.  To ensure that integrity of each block mechanisms are put in place to make sure the data is not tampered with or the transaction is not reveresed.  There are two - Proof of Work (POW) or Proof of Stake (POS).  
The Proof of Work (POW) is a mechanism where you have several peer-to-peer networks that check the integretity of each block before it is added to the the blockchain.  Each network has a copy of the blockchain.  Before a block is added the blockchain, each network / computer must have consensus each transaction and work to together to compile the next block that will be added to the blockchain.  The amount of redunancy (computers used to validate the data) and cost can affect the value of what is being purchased on the blockchain.  It can also have an high cost on the enviornment-increasing the number of computers uses generates a lot heat and uses a large amount of electricity.  Proof of Stake (POS) addresses those issues. 
Proof of Stake (POS) randomly chooses a person(s) that is/are most vested (has the most coins) in the blockchain. Those persons are chosen to computate and validate the data in each block before it is added to the blockchian.  Both POW and POS uses smart contracts to govern how the data should be compiled. 
2. Smart contracts are digital preliminary rules that each computer (or node) /network must be agree to computate the data for each block.  Each node has a copy of these smart contracts and must follow each rule before moving to the next set of instructions.  The rules (digital instructions) are automatic and are predetermined.  These instructions has information on how the data is represented  on the blockchain, exceptions for each transactoin and a framework if there is a conflict. 
3. A script is a list of instructions that are recorded for each transaction within in the blockchain. 
A transaction is an exchange (usually monetary) within the blockchain. Each transaction is a block added to the blockchain .
